// BUILDING A REACT PROJECT - BGCHANGER

● To write inline CSS in JSX, we need to write styles in:

style={{styles}}

In this condition we don't need to give another {} to write a variable. Just simply write the variable name.

● onClick expects a callback.

● The props of a component is only and only the attributes and properties given to it where it is imported.
