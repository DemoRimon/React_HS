/*
// CREATION OF A REACT PROJECT

● If we want to use React without any framework like Next.js, we have to use bundlers like Vite, Parcel etc.

● Bundlers bundle the JS code we had written in different files for the same project.

● React.js has two attachments along with it: 1. React-DOM 2. React-native

For making websites we use React-DOM along with React core library and for making mobile apps we use React-native along with React core library.

● 3js can be used to make animations.

● We can make a react project by following ways:

1. npx create-react-app <project_name> // It is very bulky time taking because it gives many bundles that we might not even need to use.
 
Here, create-react-app is an utility(software) that create a new react app.

2. npm create vite@latest

Here, create is an utility. latest implies to create a vite app that is latest. After entering this commmand we can set the necessary info by providing them.

● Some package managers are built-in with many programming languages that allow us to install libraries. npm(node package manager) is given with node that helps in managing packages in node. npx(node package executer) directly executes an utility without first installing them.

● Vite and Parcel are also utilites.

● We can build custom build process by taking react and react-DOM from npm.

● Dependencies in package.json are the libraries that the project is dependent upon. There could be testing libraries, react-scripts, scripts, web-vitals etc.

● scripts:

start: For starting react app in development environment.

build: Generates equivalent HTML, CSS and JS from the React App in production environment(in Browser). 

test: To run test cases for the project.

eject: It ejects the project from React library and lets to adjoin other frameworks or libraries to the project and further with them.

● eslintConfig: They provide suggestions where we could improve our code.

● Browserslist Contains the browser where the project could run in both development and production.

● We need to be in the directory of the project to run diff scripts on the project. Moreover, the package.json must be available in the directory to run the scripts from the package.json.

● We can apply scripts by:

npm run script_name

● When we run the build script, all JS, CSS and HTML that we wrote in React gets converted into the respective files. These files are at the end served to users.

● Projects in vanilla JS are also made in same way.

● Read package.json to know thoroughly about the project.s

● devDependencies are used only during development, they are not supplied to users.

● If node_modules folder is not available in a project, go inside the projects directory and enter 'npm i' or 'npm install'. This will install all the packages necessary for the project.

● Update README.md file for every project.

● For most of the time we will be inside the 'src' folder in project and develop.

● We saw that in project made with React, instead of .jsx there were .js files. If React were a framework, the whole project would have crashed, because frameworks are very strict and thus, naming is also important. Even though we were writing JSX in JS file, as React is library, it forgave this and executed the file as .jsx even after it is written as .js
